### Explore Page
On the explore page, users are presented with a list of national parks that is filterable based on park designation, activities, states, and distance. A map with markers at the location of each park is also displayed, and each marker will display an info window upon clicking. The user can navigate to the park detail page by either clicking on the park tile or the link within the info window.
